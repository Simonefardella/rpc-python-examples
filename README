This repository includes small python example applications that use the RS-485 port of the Raspicomm.

Here is how to use it:

- You will need the pyserial python module to use these applications. To install use these commands:
  wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pyserial/pyserial-2.6.tar.gz
  tar zxvf pyserial-2.6.tar.gz
  cd pyserial-2.6/
  sudo python setup.py install

- Use GIT to clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi:
  git clone https://github.com/amescon/rpc-python-examples.git

- The repository includes the following sample apps:
  - rs485_read
    Receives 10 bytes from the RS-485 port and displays them afterwards.

- Change to the directory of the application that you want to run:
  cd rpc-python-examples/rs485_read/

- Run the python code.:
  ./rs485_read.py

- Time to have some fun! Modify the code and test your changes!
